# Star Wars RPG Game

## Description ##
A Star Wars role playing game that allows the user to choose a character to play with and against. Characters can attack other characters. The winner will be decided based on who "kills" the other character first. Each character has a defined number of attack/health points.

## Challenges ##
A challenge that I faced when creating this game was finding a way to format each character card to allow the information for each character to be easily updated. After some research, I decided the simplest approach was to dynamically create each character card using a for loop to loop through each character object and assign properties such as character name/image, health points, and character id. This approach made it easy to manipulate and update each character card/status based on what the user clicked.
